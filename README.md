# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a minor bug in a simple Julia function. The `myfunction` function is intended to square positive inputs and negate negative inputs. However, it produces an unexpected output for an input of zero, returning zero instead of raising an error or handling the case explicitly. The solution demonstrates how to improve the function's behavior, such as adding an explicit check for zero or using a more concise approach.

## Bug Description
The function doesn't explicitly handle the case when the input `x` is zero. A more robust function should include an explicit check for this condition.

## Bug Solution
The solution introduces an explicit check for `x == 0` to provide a more robust and expected function behavior.
